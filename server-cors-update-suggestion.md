# CORS Configuration Update Suggestion

## Current Issue

There's a CORS error when trying to use the PATCH method for updating course status. The error message is:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses/67fa6cbee54ea0ba36f35e04/status' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Method PATCH is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods in preflight response.
```

## Current Configuration

In `server.js`, the CORS middleware is configured as follows:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000', 
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Cookie']
}));
```

## Suggested Update

Update the CORS configuration to include the PATCH method:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000', 
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Cookie']
}));
```

## Temporary Workaround

As a temporary workaround, we've updated the client code to use the PUT method instead of PATCH for updating course status. This works because the PUT method is already allowed in the CORS configuration.

## Benefits of Including PATCH

The PATCH method is semantically more appropriate for partial updates (like changing just the status field) compared to PUT, which is typically used for replacing an entire resource. Including PATCH in the allowed methods would allow for more RESTful API design.
